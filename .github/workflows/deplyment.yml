# Template deployment workflow for Fusion applications
# This workflow builds, generates configuration, and publishes the application to Fusion
# Edit the workflow as needed to fit your application's requirements
#
# The workflow consists of three main jobs:
#   1. build: Compiles and packages the application into a distributable bundle
#   2. config: Generates environment-specific configuration files (supports multiple environments via matrix)
#   3. publish: Deploys the application to Fusion with the appropriate configuration

name: Fusion Application Deployment Workflow Template

# The permissions the workflow needs to run
# - id-token: Required for OpenID Connect authentication with Azure
# - contents: Required to read the repository contents during checkout
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

# Trigger the workflow on push to the specified branch and paths if needed
# Change to what fits your repository structure
on:
