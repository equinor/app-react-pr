# This is a template workflow for deploying Fusion applications on pull requests.
# It builds, generates configuration, and publishes the application to Fusion for PR checks.
# Modify the workflow as necessary to suit your application's needs.
#
# The workflow consists of three main jobs:
#   1. build: Compiles and packages the application into a distributable bundle
#   2. config: Generates environment-specific configuration for the PR environment
#   3. publish: Deploys the application to Fusion and links it to the pull request

name: Fusion Application PR Deployment Workflow Template

# The permissions the workflow needs to run
# - id-token: Required for OpenID Connect authentication with Azure
# - contents: Required to read the repository contents during checkout
# - pull-requests: Required for the publish action to read/write comments on the PR
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

# Trigger the workflow on pull requests to the specified branch and paths if needed
# Change to what fits your repository structure
