# Deploy Application Workflow
# Reusable workflow for building and deploying Fusion Framework applications.
# Supports both monorepo and single-package project structures.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Azure service principal with Fusion Framework permissions
# - App registered in Fusion Application Service
# - Environment variables: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, APP_PUBLISH_SCOPE
#
# Commands:
# - `fusion-framework-cli app pack`: Creates app-bundle.zip
# - `fusion-framework-cli app publish`: Uploads bundle to Fusion registry
# - `fusion-framework-cli app config --publish`: Deploys environment configuration
#
# Project Structure Detection:
# - Monorepo: apps/{app-name}/ directory
# - Single package: package.json and app.manifest.ts in root
