# 🚀 CI Application Workflow
#
# This workflow handles Continuous Integration for Fusion applications, specifically
# managing automated releases using Changesets. It's triggered on pushes to the main
# branch and handles the complete release lifecycle.
#
# Key Features:
# - Changeset Integration: Automates version bumping and release management
# - Release Automation: Creates GitHub releases and publishes packages  
# - PR Management: Automatically creates and manages release PRs
# - Draft Safety: Converts release PRs to draft to prevent accidental merging
# - Git Configuration: Sets up proper git user for automated commits
#
# Workflow Process:
# 1. Checkout repository with full history (needed for changesets)
# 2. Configure git user as the triggering actor
# 3. Setup Node.js environment and install dependencies
# 4. Run changesets action which:
#    - Creates a "Version Packages" PR if there are pending changesets
#    - OR publishes packages and creates GitHub releases if release PR is merged
# 5. Convert any created PR to draft status for safety
#
# Permissions Required:
# - contents: write (for creating releases and commits)
# - pull-requests: write (for managing release PRs)
# - issues: write (for release notes)
# - id-token: write (for OpenID Connect authentication)
#
# Secrets Required:
# - PAT_TOKEN: Personal Access Token for GitHub API access (needed for releases)
#
# Changesets Workflow:
# - When changes are made, developers add changesets using `pnpm changeset`
# - This workflow detects pending changesets and creates a "Version Packages" PR
# - When the PR is merged, packages are published and releases are created
# - The release PR is kept as draft to prevent accidental auto-merging
#
# Concurrency:
# - Only one CI run per PR to prevent conflicts during release process
# - Uses PR ID for grouping related runs
